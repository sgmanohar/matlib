% Function to stream data from squeezy device
% require MP Acquisition daemon to be running
% 'timeOfLastAcquisition':
%  Needs to know the time of the last acquisition in order to calculate 
%  how many samples to dequeue before starting this acquisition.
%  The first time you call this in a trial, you should send the time that
%  the acquisition started - i.e. tr.startSqueezyAcquisition.
%  Subsequent calls in the same trial must pass the value returned from
%  this function 'timeOfLastAcquisition'.
%
% The function blocks execution until either 
% 1) the force exceeds 'stopRecordingAtThreshold'
% 2) the time elapsed exceeds 'maxTimeToWait'.
%
% The function returns a matrix 'sqeezeData(TIME,CHANNEL)' 
% which is the force data for the left and right channels
% and also if any keys were pressed, they are in the vector 'keys',
% otherwise this vector is empty.
%
% Finally, we also return "timeOfLastAcquisition" which is the time that we
% last checked the MP150 stream. This is needed for further calls, to know
% how much data to de-queue
%
% continuousFeedbackFunction( currentForce )
%  should be a function that can be called repeatedly each time new samples
%  are acquired. You can do the drawing in here.
